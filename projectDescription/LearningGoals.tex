\section*{Learning Goals}
\subsection*{Reinforcement learning}
Investigate how to apply reinforcement learning to the task of playing Tetris. Documented by the application of CMA-ES and CE algorithms to optimize an agent for playing Tetris, and further by description in the final report.

\subsection*{Neural Network}
Learn how other researchers have approached designing Tetris agents, and
how these are tuned with various algorithms. This will be documented in the 
report as a littereture review and reproduction of results from related works.

\subsection*{CMA-ES and CE}
Learn the fundamentals of genetic evolutionary algorithms
and in particular how CMA-ES end CE works. 
Documented in separate theoretical sections of the final report, 
describing how they function in the project implementation.
