\section*{Requirements}

\subsection*{Running environment}
The implementation will be tested and run 
on a UNIX system, namely Ubuntu 14. However, 
the implementation does not contain 
any platform specific assets ad should run on 
other platforms as well. 

\subsection*{Simulation configurations}
Without initial knowledge about the time consumption of simulations 
needed to evaluate agents, expectations are that the 
experiment will be optimized for running in few configurations
that matches similar experiments conducted by others.

\subsection*{Documentation}
The implementation of the CE algorithm in the SHARK 
library will aspire to be similar to the general 
documentation style of the SHARK library.\\
Alongside, the configuration and the execution of the 
experiment will be documented as part of the report.
