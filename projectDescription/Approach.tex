\section*{Approach and milestones}
The following strategy will be utilized
\begin{itemize}
\item Upload project contract. (20-11-2015)
\item Upload synopsis. (04-12-2015)
\item Learn about the state-of-the-art in RL for Tetris.
\item Configure a system with the necessary packages and installations to solve the project problem. (before 01-12-2015)
\item Design and implement an agent for Tetris. (before 04-12-2015)
\item Apply CMA-ES algorithm to train an agent for playing Tetris. (CMA-ES is already implemented in SHARK library)
 (before 11-12-2015)
\item Implement a version of the CE algorithm. (Algorithm is not included in the SHARK library) (before 25-12-2015)
\item Apply the implemented CE algorithm to train an agent for playing Tetris. (after 25-12-2015)
\item Run a set number of simulations to acquire data for statistical analysis of performance between the two algorithms.
\ Conduct statistical analysis to determine if one of the algorithms performs better at training an agent for playing Tetris than the other. (before 02-01-2016)
\item Process data and incorporate results in report. (before 18-01-2016)
\item Hand in report. (18-01-2016)
\item Thesis defense. (28/29-01-2016)
\end{itemize}
