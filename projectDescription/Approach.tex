\section*{Approach}
The following strategy will be utilized
\begin{itemize}
\item Configure a system with the necessary packages and installations to solve the project problem.
\item Design and implement an agent for Tetris. 
\item Apply CMA-ES algorithm to train an agent for playing Tetris. (CMA-ES is already implemented in SHARK library)
\item Implement a version of the CE algorithm. (Algorithm is not included in the SHARK library)
\item Apply the implemented CE algorithm to train an agent for playing Tetris.
\item Run a set number of simulations to acquire data for statistical analysis of performance between the two algorithms.
\ Conduct statistical analysis to determine if one of the algorithms performs better at training an agent for playing Tetris than the other.
\end{itemize}
