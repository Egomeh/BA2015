\section*{Previous work}

This thesis will focus on the performance difference between
CMA-ES and CE  \citep{cetut:14}. Most comparisons of the two 
has yet been conducted using only simpler tasks such as
pole balancing agents\citep{heidrich-meisner:09}. Thus, this thesis is to 
uncover whether a performance difference exists between the
two methods, when applied to a more complex task such a playing Tetris.
