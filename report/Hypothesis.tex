\section{Hypothesis}

Prior to any execution of experiments it's assumed that, purely based 
on a theoretical standpoint, that the CMA algorithm will be able to 
find better solutions than Cross Entropy. The assumption is based 
on the fact that CMA is, to a higher degree, able to adjust to the 
search space. Yet, as Cross Entropy is a simpler algorithm that needs 
to adjust fewer parameters. Hence, another expectation is that the 
Cross Entropy will converge faster than CMA, but at lower scores.\\
