\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Setup}

In the Tetris emulation, the agent playing is 
very much similar to the one described in \citep{scherrer2015}.
In this setup, the tetris game has a state consisting of the 
board layout $b$ and the current piece $p$ controlled by the agent.
The tetris emulator \cite{mdptetris} exposes the agent to all 
possible locations to place the piece. The agent then uses the 
feature function \ref{section:scope} to evaluate the immediate
reward each move would yield, and finally chooses the one offering 
the highest value.

\subsection{Results}

What were the results of the experiment? This section will
present theoutcome of the experiment, or refer to data.

\subsection{Analysis}

How do CE and CMA-ES compare from our data? Can we say anything 
which performs better?
