\subsection{Verification of CE}
Because the \shark library already contains an implementation of 
CMA-ES, but not an implementation of CE, we extended the library 
with our own implementation of the algorithm. 
This ensures as many similar conditions as possible for 
the two optimization algorithms as possible.\\
In order to verify the correctness of the implementation, 
we used the same experiments as used by 
Christophe Thiery and Bruno Scherrer \citep{thiery:09}. 
These experiments were used be Thiery and Scherrer to 
verify their own CE implementation with various types of noise correction. 
Therefore, we will utilize the same experiments to verify our 
own contribution to the \shark library, by trying to achieve the same results.\\
\\
The setup is mirrored as in the paper \citep{thiery:09}, 
with 100 agents ($\populationSize = 100$) per iteration. 
The 10 best agents ($\offspringNumber = 10$) will be used 
to generate the new gaussian distribution. After each iteration, 
an agent with the mean weights from the $\offspringNumber$ best agents, 
play 30 games.\\
The paper does not specify the number of games 
played with each agent in an iteration to evaluate their fitness. 
Thus it is assumed they also play 30 games.\\

\subsection{Setup}

In the Tetris emulation, the agent playing is 
very much similar to the one described in \citep{scherrer2015}.
In this setup, the tetris game has a state consisting of the 
board layout $b$ and the current piece $p$ controlled by the agent.
The tetris emulator \cite{mdptetris} exposes the agent to all 
possible locations to place the piece. The agent then uses the 
feature function \ref{section:scope} to evaluate the immediate
reward each move would yield, and finally chooses the one offering 
the highest value.

\subsection{Results}

What were the results of the experiment? This section will
present theoutcome of the experiment, or refer to data.

\subsection{Analysis}

How do CE and CMA-ES compare from our data? Can we say anything 
which performs better?
