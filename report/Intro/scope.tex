\subsection{Scope and limitations \label{section:scope}}


The experiments will be carried out on the simplified version of
Tetris using the MDPTetris software found at \citep{mdptetris},
which is the same simulator used by Scherrer et al. in \citep{scherrer2009:b} 
among other authors in various papers.
This software already have the well known feature sets
implemented, so we will not ourselves extend any of the features.
The source code of the Tetris simulator is used as-is, and is therefore 
not altered prior to running the experiments. 
For comparing the optimizers, the \shark library will be used. 
This library already contains an
implementation of the CMA-ES optimizer, but lacks the 
Cross-Entropy. Therefore, a part of this thesis will
be to implement and document the Cross-Entropy method in Shark.
