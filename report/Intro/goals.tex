\subsection{Goals of the thesis}

Both the Cross-entropy method and the CMA-ES have been used 
for learning Tetris with \textit{one piece controllers}, but as 
mentioned, to our knowledge, only little effort has been put into 
comparing the two algorithms. This thesis will explore
how the two methods compare against each other under similar
conditions. Therefore, we will use a set of features among those
commonly used, and compare how the two optimizing algorithms 
differ. The goal however is not to find a controller that 
outperforms existing controllers, but only to investigate 
how the Cross-entropy method and CMA-ES differs when learning Tetris
with similar controllers.\\
\\
In this thesis, we will explore how the two state-of-the-art
optimization algorithms, Cross-entropy method and CMA-ES, differ when 
applied to the task of playing Tetris.\\
\\
The Shark library \citep{shark08} contains a
working implementation of the CMA-ES 
algorithm. As mentioned earlier, the Cross-entropy method 
is not present in the Shark library and thus, 
a part of the thesis is to implement it ourselves according to 
the work of other researchers. To document the 
soundness of the implemented Cross-entropy method, 
we will replicate the experiment in \citep{thiery:09} and 
verify that we obtain the similar results.
Then, we will benchmark CMA-ES and the Cross-entropy method against each other 
to determine if one yields better optimization results than the other.
