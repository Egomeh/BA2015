\subsubsection{Global comparison settings}
In all papers used for reference we haven't seen any experiments with different population
and parent sizes presented side-by-side. All the experiments we've seen
that has applied Cross Entropy to Tetris fix the population size to 100. 
However, in our upcoming experiments
CMA and CE are configured with different population and parnet numbers, which means
that we cannot compare the learning curves based on iterations/generations. Instead as described
in section \ref{varifyofce}, using the  
\textit{number of games played} as comparison reference, equal terms are secured for both algorithms 
in regards to learning speed. \\
Hence x-axis shows the total number 
of Tetris games evaluated, 
$\sum_{i = 1}^{\generation} \populationSize \numberOfEvaluations$. 
Meanwhile the y-axis still represents the mean score 
of the centroid agent at iteration $\generation$.
