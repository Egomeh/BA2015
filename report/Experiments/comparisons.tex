\subsection{Comparison between Cross Entropy and CMA}

In this section, we present the actual comparison experiments between the Cross-entropy method
and CMA-ES.\\
In the first experiment, we conduct a comparison experiment using the 
"default" settings for both CMA-ES and the Cross-entropy method. We use this experiment to
get an initial idea of how the two algorithms compare to each other, when using the commonly
used algorithm parameters.\\
In the second experiment, we conduct an experiment using the "optimized" settings
specified in section \ref{optimalsettingsce} for the Cross-entropy method and section
\ref{optimalsettingscma} for CMA-ES.\\
These experiments are used to conclude whether CMA-ES or the Cross-entropy method
is the better algorithm for learning Tetris.
