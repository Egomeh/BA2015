\subsection{Comparison between Cross Entropy and CMA}

In this section, we are going to conduct the actual comparison experiments between the Cross-entropy method
and CMA-ES.\\
In first experiment, we are going to conduct a comparison experiment using the 
"default" settings for both CMA-ES and the Cross-entropy method. We use this experiment to
get an initial idea of how the two algorithms compare to each other, when using the commonly
used algorithm parameters.\\
In the second experiment, we are going to conduct a experiment using the "optimized" settings
specified in section \ref{optimalsettingsce} for the Cross-entropy method and section
\ref{optimalsettingscma} for CMA-ES.\\
These experiments are going to conclude on whether that CMA-ES or the Cross-entropy method
is the better algorithm for learning Tetris.
