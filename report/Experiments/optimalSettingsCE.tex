\subsection{Optimal settings 
for Cross Entropy \label{optimalsettingsce}}

\subsubsection{Population and selection size}

Other researchers run the Cross Entropy algorithm with population size of
$\populationSize = 100$ and an offspring corresponding to 10\% of 
the population size, resulting in $\offspringNumber = 10$. As it's not 
discussed why this exact setting is applied, various settings of the 
Cross-Entropy was executed to asses the performance of other configurations
in our experiments.
The experiments includes different population sizes 
$\populationSize \in \{10, 22, 50, 100, 200\}$ and offspring 
sizes of either $10\%$ and $50\%$ (since the CMA algorithm by default
uses $50 \%$ selected vectors). 
A summary of the experiments can be seen in figure \ref{CEConfigTest}
on page \pageref{CEConfigTest}.

The experiments with different population and parent sizes
does not seem to support a choice for any other configuration 
than the mostly commonly used 
$\populationSize = 100$ and $\offspringNumber = 10$. \\
However, with a configuration of $\populationSize = 50$ and $\offspringNumber = 5$ convergence
is achieved faster (see figure \ref{fig:bestConfCE}). This means that the score limit is reached faster, which
results in longer computation time, than the $\populationSize = 100$ and $\offspringNumber = 10$
configuration. In other words, the $\populationSize = 100$ and $\offspringNumber = 10$ configuration 
is therefore preferred since it takes shorter computation time and the end-result is similar compared
to the $\populationSize = 50$ and $\offspringNumber = 5$ configuration, even though the latter 
configuration from our expriments converged faster. The experiments also apppears
to suffer from a high noise, yet both the mean and the quantiles favor the 
extensively tested Cross Entropy configuration of $\populationSize = 100$ and $\offspringNumber = 10$.
