\section{Experiments}
The following section contains all of the conducted experiments and results thereof.\\
As stated in the previous section describing the goal of the thesis, section
\ref{section:GoalOfTheThesis}. The primary question we wish to investigate is which of
Cross Entropy method or the CMA-ES algorithms can be said to perform better
than the other, when applied to task of playing Tetris.\\
The section will provide a discussion on how the experiments are carried out, mainly
in terms of how the Tetris emulator is integrated with Shark and how the games settings were configured.\\
The section also covers an experiment that serves the purpose of indicating whether our implementation 
of the Cross Entropy algorithm behaves as intended, by comparing the results to experiments
conducted in other papers. \\
We wish ensure that both algorithms operate under the 
best configurations in regards to the Tetris problem. To satisfy this, a series of experiments, with altering settings for each 
algorithm is run to reveal the optimal parameters to obtain the best performance from 
each algorithm.
