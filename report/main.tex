\begin{abstract}
In this thesis, we conduct an unbiased comparison between 
the Cross Entropy Method and the Covariance Matrix Adaption
Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) in training 
an agent to play the classical game, Tetris. Many researchers have 
previously explored methods for constructing artificial Tetris
agents, but mostly focusing on how to maximize the score of the agents.
A common approach is to construct a configurable controller
and apply some optimization algorithm from the field of machine learning
to set the parameters for the best possible controller. Using the 
commonly used MDPTetris \citep{mdptetris} platform, the Cross Entropy
method is benchmarked against the CMA-ES algorithm under the same
conditions to reach an empirical understanding of how the two algorithms
compare when applied to Tetris.\\
\\
No conclusion yet.
