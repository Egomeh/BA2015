\begin{abstract}
We conduct a comparison between 
the Cross-entropy method and the Covariance Matrix Adaption
Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) for training 
an agent to play the classic video game Tetris. Many researchers have 
previously explored methods for constructing artificial Tetris
agents, but mostly focusing on outperfroming competeting controllers.
A common approach is to construct a configurable controller
and apply some optimization algorithm from the field of machine learning
to set the parameters for the best possible controller. Using the 
commonly used MDPTetris \citep{mdptetris} platform, the Cross-entropy
method is benchmarked against the CMA-ES algorithm under the same
conditions to reach an empirical understanding of how the two algorithms
compare when applied to Tetris. The results from our experiments
suggests that the Cross-entropy method is the preferable choice
between the two. They appear to reach similar scores, 
but the Cross-entropy method reaches this score almost twice as
fast as CMA-ES.
