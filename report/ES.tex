\section{Evolutionary Algorithms}

Maybe a short intro on evolutionary algorithms.

\subsection{General black-box optimizations}

How we expect the CMA-ES and CE to work from theory.

\subsection{Cross Entropy}

How we interpret the cross entropy approach and how we implement it.

\subsection{CMA-ES}

Same as above, but with CMA-ES.
