\subsection{Symbols}

$\mean$, the mean of a distribution.\\
\\
$\varianceMatrix$, the matix used as second argument to the gaussian distribution, which describes the shape of the distribution. Ususaly, when a sample from a gaussian distribution 
is drawn, it's written as: $x \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \mu, \sigma^{2} \right)$, however in \citep{hansen2011},
$\mu$ and $\sigma$ is used for other purposes, and therefore these symbols are kept for this.\\
\\
$\populationSize$, number of agents generated per generation/iteration.\\
\\
$\numberOfEvaluations$, number of games played by each agent for evaluation.\\
\\
$\offspringNumber$, number of the population samples is included in the next generation.\\
\\
$\fitnessFunction$, the function that estimates the performance of an agent/sample point.\\
\\
$\noise$, noise term added to the variance, specific to Cross-Entropy.\\
\\
$\generation$, counter indicating the current generation/iteration.\\
\\
$\weight$, the weight configuration of a Tetri playing agent($\dimensions $-dimensional vector).\\
\\
$\feature$, A feature of the Tetris game state. This is a function that maps a 
feature of the Tetris board to a real value.\\
\\
$\valueFunction$, A linear combination of feature functions and weight. 
The function used for evaluating a Tetris game state. The function is composed of feature sets and thier
asociated weights, accepts a game state, and yields a single real-value.\\
\\
$\gameState$, the state of the Tetris game.\\
\\
$\individual$, an individual agent/search point from a generation/iteration. 
Represented with an $\dimensions$-dimensional vector.
