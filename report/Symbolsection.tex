\subsection{Symbols}

$\mean$, the mean of a distribution.\\
\\
$\varianceMatrix$, the matix used as second argument to the gaussian distribution, which describes the shape of the distribution.\\
\\
$\populationSize$, number of agents generated per generation/iteration.\\
\\
$\numberOfEvaluations$, number of games played by each agent for evaluation.\\
\\
$\offspringNumber$, number of the population samples that carries over.\\
\\
$\fitnessFunction$, the function that estimates the performance of an agent.\\
\\
$\noise$, noise term added to the variance.\\
\\
$\generation$, counter indicating the current generation/iteration.\\
\\
$\weight$, the weights of a single agent ($1 \times \dimensions$ vector).\\
\\
$\feature$, an information the agent is aware of. This is a function that yields a single number.\\
\\
$\valueFunction$, the linear function of feature weights. The function used for evaluating a state.\\
\\
$\gameState$, the state of the Tetris game.\\
\\
$\individual$, an individual agent from a generation/iteration. Represented with an $\dimensions$ dimensional vector.
