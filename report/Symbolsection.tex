\section*{Symbols}

$\mean$, the mean of a distribution.\\
\\
$\varianceMatrix$, the matrix used as 
second argument to the Gaussian distribution, 
which describes the shape of the distribution. 
Usually, when a sample from a Gaussian distribution 
is drawn, it is written as: 
$x \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \mu, \sigma^{2} \right)$, 
however in \citep{hansen2011},
$\mu$ and $\sigma$ are used for other 
purposes, and therefore these symbols are reserved for this.\\
\\
$\populationSize$, number of search points sampled per generation.\\
\\
$\numberOfEvaluations$, number of games played by each agent for evaluation.\\
\\
$\offspringNumber$, number of the population samples included in the next generation.\\
\\
$\fitnessFunction$, the function that estimates the performance of a search point.\\
\\
$\noise$, noise term added to the variance, specific to the Cross-entropy method.\\
\\
$\generation$, counter indicating the current generation.\\
\\
$\weight$, the weight configuration of a Tetris playing agent ($\dimensions $-dimensional vector).\\
\\
$\feature$, a feature of the Tetris game state. This is a function that maps a 
feature of the Tetris board to a real value.\\
\\
$\valueFunction$, a linear combination of feature functions and weight. 
The function used for evaluating a Tetris game state. 
The function is composed of a linear combination of feature sets and their
associated weights. It accepts a game state and yields a single real-value.\\
\\
$\MDPState$, a state of the Tetris game board, meaning the
configuration of pieces located the board.\\
\\
$\individual$, an individual search point from a generation. 
Represented with an $\dimensions$-dimensional vector.
