\section{Conclusion}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Conclude on initial comparison and tuned comparison (and normal distribution vs. covariance experiment comparison)
\item outline - talk about dynamic games per agent (show graphs), using normal tetris for 
tuning also
\item sample agents using angles instead of distributions, this removes a dimension and allows for a lesser random/more through search.
\end{enumerate}


\comment{When only testing 1 game pr agent, we observe that after 8000 agents it starts to decline in
 score, thus finding worse performing agents - some conclusion that cma with 1 game pr agent should be
  run only for some time and not infinityly}
\comment{as seen on ex. population 12, parent size 6, linear, if played with dynamic games, meaning 1 game up to 500 agent and then a higher games per agent afterwards, a fast convergence and high score is achieved.}
