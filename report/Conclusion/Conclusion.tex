\section{Conclusion}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Conclude on initial comparison and tuned comparison (and normal distribution vs. covariance experiment comparison)
\item outline - talk about dynamic games per agent (show graphs), using normal tetris for 
tuning also
\item sample agents using angles instead of distributions, this removes a dimension and allows for a lesser random/more through search.
\end{enumerate}
